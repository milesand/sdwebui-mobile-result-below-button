# SD Web UI - Generation result below the button

This is an extension for [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), intended to improve mobile UX by moving generation result below the generation button, on mobile only.

This extension's intended use case is for running the UI with `--listen` on a beefy machine, and then accessing it on a mobile device. In other words, this does not let you run the image generation itself on a mobile device.
